## Description
This repository contains the raw data and analysis code for our study examining haptic expertise and movement trajectories in expert vs novice performers.

## Data Structure
- `raw_data/`: Contains all experimental measurements
- `trajectory_data/`: 3D movement trajectories (X, Y, Z coordinates)
- `angle_data/`: Angular measurements (start and max angles)
- `velocity_data/`: Velocity measurements (max and mean)
- `performance_data/`: Accuracy and error measurements
- `analysis_code/`: Processing scripts for FFT, PSD, and statistical analyses

## File Format
- .txt files: Tab-delimited raw measurements
- .csv files: Comma-separated processed data
- .xlsx files: Excel format with multiple sheets
